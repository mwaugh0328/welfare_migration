% Fraction with no liquid assets

% The experiment hybrid is a combination of conrol and experiment...
% seasonal migration in control
% increase in r1 (22 percent)
% increase in r2 (9.2 percent)
% LATE estiamte
% OLS estimate
% Standard deviation of consumption growth. See line 433 in
% ``compute_outcomes.``

% Note there is currently an inconsistency between the numbers in the table
% and what I have here. 0.40 corresponds with a variance of 0.16, note 0.18
% which is what is in my slides. To edit: onece we have a consistent
% number, we should change code so we work in only variances or stds.

% Also note how this is working, in ``compute_outcomes'' we do not include
% measurment error in the out put moments. The idea is that since it is
% additive, we only need to check ex-post what the measurment error is.
% This simplifies the calibration since we are calibrating 2 less
% parameters.
